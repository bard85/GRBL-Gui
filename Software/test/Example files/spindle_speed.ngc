;This file is a test for spindle speed syntax and describes the rules for S-parameter
;Spindle speed S is set with parameter S followed by a number(Integer, float)
;Unit is RPM
;Spindle speed needs to be >=0
;Only one S can be present on a line

;Examples of a program with ok spindle speed:

N01 S10000
N10 M03 S10000
N20 G01 X10 S2000



;Examples of illegal uses of spindle speed:

N10 S-300 ;Negative value
N20 S2000 S3000 ; Multiple S is not allowed
N30 S ; No value assigned to S

;Illegal uses of spindle speed will result in error and the program will not be able to start
