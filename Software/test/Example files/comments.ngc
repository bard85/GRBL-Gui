;This file is a test for comment syntax and describes the rules of comments
;Comments can be inside brackets or after a semi colon
;All text after a semi colon is treated as a comment
;There can only be one semi colon on a line
;Semi colons cant be inside brackets
;It is not legal to nest a comment inside another comment
;A comment cant be between an instruction, G/M-code and its value
;Legal examples shown below:

G01 (this comment is ok) X0.4 Y0.0 ;And so is this comment
G01 (This is comment number one) X0 (This is comment number two) Y0 (This is a third comment)
M03 ;This comment is ok
G90 ;Comment start(this is actually ok to do)

;Examples of illegal uses of comments:
G(this comment is between instruction and value, not ok)90
G90 (Starting a comment but not closing it with end bracket
G90 (Trying to nest a comment inside another comment   (nested comment)   )
G90 (Semi colon inside brackets is not ok ;trying to nest a semi colon within brackets)

;Illegal uses of comments will result in error and the program will not be able to start
