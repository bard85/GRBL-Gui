;This file is a test for line numbering syntax and describes the rules for line numbering
;A line number starts with an N followed by a number(Integer)
;The N must be first character on the line
;The number following the N needs to be >= 0
;Only one N can be present on one line

;Examples of a program with ok Line numbering:

N01 G90
N10 G01 X0.04
N20 M30
N30 ;Blank row



;Examples of illegal uses of line numbering:

G90 N01 ;N is not first char)
N02 N03 G90 ;Multiple N's found
N-3 ;Negative line number
N12.3 G90 ;Number is not an integer
N G90 ;Missing a line number

;Illegal uses of line numbering will result in error and the program will not be able to start
