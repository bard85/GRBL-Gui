;This file is a test for feed rate syntax and describes the rules for F-parameter
;Feed rate F is set with parameter F followed by a number(Integer, float)
;Feed rate needs to be >=0
;Only one F can be present on a line

;Examples of a program with ok feed rate:

N01 F1000
N10 M03 F1000
N20 G01 X10 F1000



;Examples of illegal uses of spindle speed:

N10 F-300 ;Negative value
N20 F2000 F3000 ; Multiple S is not allowed
N30 F ; No value assigned to S

;Illegal uses of feed rate will result in error and the program will not be able to start
