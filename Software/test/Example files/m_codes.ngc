;This file is a test for M syntax and describes the rules M-code
;
;Supported M-codes by the GRBL(1.1) is:
;M0: Program stop
;M2: Program End
;M3: Start spindle CW
;M4: Start spindle CCW
;M5: Stop spindle
;M7*: Mist Coolant on(*Not supported by the validator)
;M8: Flood coolant on
;M9: Coolant off
;M30: Program end(see M02) and return to program start
;M56*: Parking mode(*Not supported by the validator)
;
;*Needs to be enabled during compiling to Arduino, not supported for now
;General syntax:
;M and G-codes can't be combined on same row
;Multiple M-codes not allowed
;M3, M4 can be set with S-parameter aswell
;M3, M4 needs a set speed(S) from before or same row
;M-codes can only be combined with S-parameter
