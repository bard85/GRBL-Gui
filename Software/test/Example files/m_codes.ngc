;This file is a test for M syntax and describes the rules M-code
;
;General syntax:
;M3, M4 needs a set speed(S) from before or same row
;2 M in same modal group can't be entered on same line
;Modal groups for M(supported by GRBL1.1) are as follow:
;Group 1 {M0, M1, M2}
;Group 2 {M3, M4, M5}
;Group 3 {M8, M9}
;These M can be combined with other groups(contaning G)


;Examples of ok M-codes
M02
N10 G00 M5
M04 S1000 ;See above, this guarantees no errors
M03 M0 M08 ;Different modal groups, ok!

;Examples of M-codes failing
M3 M5 S3000 ;Can't use 2 M-codes in same group
M X0 ; No M-value assigned
M90 ;Unsupported M-code



;Illegal uses of M-code will result in error and the program will not be able to start
