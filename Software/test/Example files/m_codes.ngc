;This file is a test for M syntax and describes the rules M-code
;
;Supported M-codes by the GRBL(1.1) is:
;M0: Program stop
;M2: Program End
;M3: Start spindle CW
;M4: Start spindle CCW
;M5: Stop spindle
;M7*: Mist Coolant on(*Not supported by the validator)
;M8: Flood coolant on
;M9: Coolant off
;M30: Program end(see M02) and return to program start
;M56*: Parking mode(*Not supported by the validator)
;
;*Needs to be enabled during compiling to Arduino, not supported for now
;General syntax:
;M and G-codes can't be combined on same row
;Multiple M-codes not allowed
;M3, M4 can be set with S-parameter aswell
;M3, M4 needs a set speed(S) from before or same row
;M-codes can only be combined with S-parameter

;Examples of ok M-codes
M02
M03 ;This may give error if no spindlespeed is set before
M04 S1000 ;See above, this guarantees no errors
M03 ;This is ok now since we set speed above

;Examples of M-codes failing
M8 M3 S3000 ;Can't use 2 M-codes
M3 G00 X0 ;Cant mix M & G
M90 ;Unsupported M-code
M03 S-200 ;Negative rpm, not ok



;Illegal uses of M-code will result in error and the program will not be able to start
