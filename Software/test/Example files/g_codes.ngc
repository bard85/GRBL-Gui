;This file is a test for G syntax and describes the rules G-code
;
;General syntax:

;2 G in same modal group can't be entered on same line
;Modal groups for G(supported by GRBL1.1) are as follow:
;Group 0 = {G4, G10, G28, G30, G53, G92, G92.1}
;Group 1= {G0, G1, G2, G3, G38.2, G80, G81, G82, G83, G84, G85, G86, G87, G88, G89} motion
;Group 2 = {G17, G18, G19} plane selection
;Group 3 = {G90, G91} distance mode
;Group 4 = {G93, G94} feed rate mode
;Group 5 = {G20, G21} units
;Group 6 = {G40} cutter radius compensation
;Group 7 = {G43, G49} tool length offset
;Group 8 = {G98, G99} return mode in canned cycles
;Group 9 = {G54, G55, G56, G57, G58, G59} coordinate system selection
;Group 10 = {G61} path control mode
;
;These G can be combined with other groups(contaning M)
;If using a command from motion group, feed rate needs to be set before or same line
;Group 0 and Group 1 canÂ´t be combined
